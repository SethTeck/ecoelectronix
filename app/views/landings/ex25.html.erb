      I needed a portable stapler that packs a punch and THIS IS IT! I have gone through two other brands that promised to staple over 20 pages on battery power and none met the test. Generally, my work produces 5 to 15 pages and the other staplers couldn't even handle that load. This one works fine every time and doesn't seem to care what brand of staples I feed it. Count me as a satisfied customer. This is a Company I like doing business with -- good product, good people.

      Who knew stapling could be this FUN? I must say that I'm very impressed. I work in an industry, where I am constantly reviewing and stapling documents together, and having an automatic stapler is awesome. It's sturdy, and even on battery power, it has handled my stapling needs, from 2-3 pages up to a 32 page document that I tried out today. Highly recommend this product to anybody that wants something that is easy to use, and is no nonsense.

      I volunteer at an elementary school as a helper for teachers with their busy work and projects. Last week I had to staple 36 packets that contained 3 manila folders each. My hand was like a crab claw by the end! I ordered this stapler for future projects and it is nothing short of amazing. It's very powerful and simple to use. Just put in the items you want stapled and bam! It's stapled. It's a good weight and compact to leave in my bag (I don't leave anything in my project room as it disappears--not this sweet baby!). I am thrilled with my purchase! My hand is no longer a claw from stapling large amounts of papers.

      I was very impressed with the personal service I received when I ordered this product. I was contacted by the owner several times to double check on my satisfaction. I had no reason to not be satisfied, but it was nice to know that if I had a problem, customer service would be A+! I gave this stapler to my son for a Christmas gift... he was actually really excited about it, and had fun trying it out. I get the impression, by the feel of this product that it is well made and will last for many, many years! I expect I may be buying more of these in the future for nieces/ nephews and my other children.

      Compact enough to fit under monitors on the desktop, it's powerful and fast. It's as small as most of the ones that only take half a strip of staples, but it accepts the full length strip. Best power stapler by far! I'm usually pretty critical of equipment because there is always some corner-cutting on reasonably priced items (lots of it on cheap items) but I'd consider this to be very reasonably priced and worth more.
